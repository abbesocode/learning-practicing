## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

# In the "member_casual" column, replace "Subscriber" with "member" and "Customer" with "casual"
# Before 2020, Divvy used different labels for these two types of riders ... we will want to make our dataframe consistent with their current nomenclature
# N.B.: "Level" is a special property of a column that is retained even if a subset does not contain any values from a specific level
# Begin by seeing how many observations fall under each usertype
```{r}
